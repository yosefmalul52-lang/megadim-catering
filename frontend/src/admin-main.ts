// Admin Dashboard Application Entry Point
// This file is used when running the admin dashboard on a separate port (4201)
// To use this, you need to modify angular.json to use this as the main entry point
// OR use environment variables to conditionally load routes

// For now, we'll use a simpler approach - just modify the main.ts to check for admin mode
// See main.ts for the implementation
